# Model Deployment Refactoring Guide

This document outlines the structure for refactoring a Python script into separate files for deployment. Use the content of this file and the `messy_model_development.py` script as context for GitHub Copilot Chat to generate the required Python files.

## File Definitions

Below are the definitions for each Python file that needs to be created.

### 1. `base_data.py`

* **Purpose**: To provide the base dataset for both model training and inference.
* **Contents**: Should contain a function `get_base_data()`. This function should find the code that loads the raw data (in this case, from `sklearn.datasets`), renames the columns, and returns the resulting pandas DataFrame.

### 2. `features.py`

* **Purpose**: To maintain a definitive list of features used by the model.
* **Contents**: Should contain a function `get_features()`. This function should find the list of feature names used for training and return it.

### 3. `development_dataset.py`

* **Purpose**: To prepare the dataset for the model retraining process.
* **Contents**: Should contain a function `create_development_dataset()`. This function will take the base DataFrame and feature list as input. It needs to find the logic for splitting the data, scaling it, and saving the scaler object to a file. It should return the prepared `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`.

### 4. `train.py`

* **Purpose**: To encapsulate the model training and saving logic.
* **Contents**: Should contain a function `train_model()` that accepts `X_train` and `y_train`. It should find the code that initializes and trains the model and then saves the trained model object to a file. It should also have a `if __name__ == '__main__':` block to orchestrate the full retraining run.

### 5. `inference.py`

* **Purpose**: To define the process for making predictions on new data.
* **Contents**: Should contain a function `run_inference(new_data)`. This function needs to locate the logic for loading the saved model and scaler, transform the new input data, and return a prediction.

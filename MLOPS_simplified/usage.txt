Critical Evaluation of This "Real-World" Approach
This method is more advanced and truly tests the capabilities of the LLM.

üëç Pros
High Practical Value: This directly addresses a common, real-world problem. It bridges the gap between messy, exploratory code and structured, production-ready code with minimal manual effort.

Focus on Intent: The data scientist's only job is to provide a working (but messy) script and the desired outcome (via the markdown file). They don't have to perform the tedious refactoring themselves.

Robustness: The deploy_model.md acts as a strong "anchor" for the AI, guiding it through the chaos of the script. It tells the AI what to look for, such as "find the part where the data is loaded" or "find the list of features."

üëé Cons & Mitigations
Increased AI "Hallucination" Risk: Because the script is disorganized, Copilot has a higher chance of misinterpreting the code or grabbing the wrong variables. For example, it might confuse a temporary, filtered DataFrame with the base dataset.

Mitigation: Human review is non-negotiable. The generated code must be inspected for correctness. Generating one file at a time, as shown in the prompts, makes this review process iterative and more manageable. You can also add a main block to train.py that runs the whole pipeline as a quick integration test.

Dependency on Code "Clues": The AI's success depends on the presence of clues in the messy script‚Äîvariable names (my_dataframe, features_to_use), comments, or library calls (load_iris, model.fit). A script with extremely vague variable names (df1, x, list1) would be much harder for the AI to parse correctly.

Mitigation: Encourage data scientists to use reasonably descriptive variable names even in their exploratory work. This is good practice anyway and significantly helps the AI assistant.
